## How This Works

**Adding tasks:**
- Just tell me: "Remember I need to..." or "Add to my to-do: ..."
- I'll add it with today's date

**Completing tasks:**
- Tell me: "I finished X" or "Mark X as done"
- Or I'll ask during check-ins if something's been pending >1 day

**Priority levels:**
- **high**: Mentioned in every morning call until done
- **medium**: Mentioned if pending >1 day
- **low**: Background tasks, mentioned weekly

**Morning calls include:**
- High priority tasks
- Overdue tasks (>1 day old, not completed)
- Any tasks due today
- Daily recurring reminders
