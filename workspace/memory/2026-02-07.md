## Limen Home Brain: Software Validation Complete (00:45-00:55)

### Research Findings

**Verified working on Pi 4:**
- `face_recognition` library (HOG detector, ~1-2 FPS)
- Waveshare e-ink Python library
- Flask for web UI
- Camera + E-ink simultaneous (no GPIO conflict — CSI vs SPI)

**Key integration point solved:**
- Camera Module 3 uses `picamera2` (new library)
- `face_recognition` examples use older `picamera`
- **Solution:** Use OpenCV's `VideoCapture(0)` — works with both, proven approach

### Performance Expectations
- Face detection: 0.3-0.5 sec per frame
- Face encoding: 0.5-1 sec per face
- E-ink partial refresh: 0.4 sec
- E-ink full refresh: 4 sec (with flash)

### Known Gotchas Documented
1. dlib compilation takes 1-2 hours (need 2GB swap)
2. E-ink ghosting — need periodic full refresh
3. Must use HOG detector (not CNN) for reasonable speed

### Files Created
- `SOFTWARE-VALIDATION.md` — detailed component analysis + proof-of-concept code

### Status
✅ Hardware validated (earlier session)
✅ Software validated (this session)
⏳ Ready to order hardware pending Kartik's go-ahead

### Kartik's Feedback
- "We're not ready to order anything until we validated software too" — good catch, I had assumed without verifying
- Lesson: Don't just write architecture docs, validate the actual integrations
