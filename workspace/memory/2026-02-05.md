# 2026-02-05 - thiccClaw Setup Day 🍑

## Identity Established
- **Name:** thiccClaw
- **Emoji:** 🍑
- **Vibe:** Chill/casual but sharp and intelligent underneath
- **Human:** Kartik Krishnan (Brooklyn, NY - EST timezone)

## Infrastructure Set Up

### Email Access
- Gmail configured: krishnankartik70@gmail.com
- IMAP/SMTP with app password
- Credentials stored in `secrets/email.json`
- Massive inbox: 34,470 messages, 32,126 unread

### Browser Control
- Using `openclaw` browser profile (autonomous, no extension needed)
- Can browse, order from Amazon, etc.
- Successfully ordered Bocce's Bakery Fireside Apple Pie dog treats ($8.70)

### Voice Assistant (Major Project)
Built progressively through the session:

1. **v1:** Basic wake word ("ThiccClaw") + local Whisper STT
   - Too slow, transcription garbled

2. **v2:** Groq Whisper API for faster STT
   - Better speed (~200ms) but still clunky pipeline

3. **v3:** Added Cartesia TTS for voice responses
   - STT → Claude → TTS pipeline
   - ~2-3 second latency, not smooth

4. **v4 (Final):** OpenAI Realtime API
   - Voice-to-voice, ~300ms latency
   - No wake word needed, natural conversation
   - Claude Opus available as `ask_claude` tool for deep reasoning
   - File: `voice-assistant/realtime_voice.py`

### API Keys Stored (in voice assistant files)
- Groq: `gsk_REDACTED`
- Cartesia: `sk_car_mqBhYtngSpEfH94gRM9DEk`
- OpenAI: `sk-proj-REDACTED`

## Gateway Config Changes
- Enabled HTTP hooks (`hooks.enabled: true`)
- Enabled chat completions API (`gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions.enabled: true`)

## Hardware Notes
- Mac mini (no built-in mic)
- NexiGo N930E FHD Webcam (device index 1) used for microphone input
- Webcam runs at 48kHz, needs resampling to 16kHz for Whisper

## Kartik's Pet
- Has a dog
- Buys Bocce's Bakery treats (Apple Pie, PB & Banana, Sweet Dreams, Burgers & Fries)
- Address: 236 N 5TH ST FL 4, Brooklyn, NY 11211

## Key Files Created
- `voice-assistant/thicclaw_voice.py` - Basic wake word version
- `voice-assistant/conversational_voice.py` - Groq + Cartesia pipeline
- `voice-assistant/realtime_voice.py` - OpenAI Realtime (current)
- `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md` - Profile files
- `secrets/email.json` - Gmail credentials

## Debugging Notes
- Initial Realtime audio playback was garbled
- Fix: Changed from async queue-based playback to proper `sd.OutputStream` with callback
- The output stream needs to run at 24kHz (OpenAI Realtime's native rate)

## ElevenLabs Phone Integration
- Configured with `x-openclaw-session-key: agent:main:main` header
- Routes phone calls to main session (shared memory with Telegram)
- Phone calls now have full context of all conversations
- Working and tested successfully

## Config Changes (Later in Session)
- **Disabled BlueBubbles/iMessage** per Kartik's request
- Set `channels.bluebubbles.enabled: false`
- Set `plugins.entries.bluebubbles.enabled: false`

## Misc
- Someone called asking for Kartik birthday gift ideas - gave suggestions (fitness, tech, food, dog stuff)
- They didn't leave their name, said they'd call back

## Anthropic PM Claude Code Application 🎯
- Created application on tailrai.com for **Product Manager, Claude Code** at Anthropic
- **Resume link:** https://tailrai.com/editor/6b9e94cc-354a-4463-9976-1996ecd1a9ea
- **Experience gap flagged**: Role asks for 5+ years PM/engineering, Kartik has 3.5 years PM
- **Positioning**: Intentional reach - leading with technical depth + power user angle

### Resume Edits Applied ✅
**Tailr section significantly strengthened:**
- Added Claude Code and Cursor mention (dogfooding the product!)
- Added 5+ custom tools with specific examples (semantic memory, resume management, job analysis, session context)
- Added LangGraph state machine architecture
- Added Pinecone vector embeddings
- Added tool calling patterns

### Not Applied (Tailr agent timed out)
- thiccClaw as second project (content was drafted but not saved)
- Skills section reorder to lead with technical skills
- Microsoft work reframe with technical lens

### Technical Issues
- Tailr agent kept timing out on long conversations
- Export PDF failed with JS error: "e.replace is not a function"
- May need to manually finish edits or start fresh conversation
