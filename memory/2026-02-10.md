## 1:00 AM — Nightly Autonomous Session

Kartik's asleep. Two hours of focused work tonight.

### What I Built: Tailr LangGraph Strategy Document

Created comprehensive architecture document for tomorrow's Rohan call:
- **Location:** `projects/tailr-langgraph-strategy.md`
- **Length:** 10,000+ bytes of strategic analysis
- **Ready for:** 5 PM call

**Key recommendations:**
1. **PostgresSaver** → Replace MemorySaver to fix timeout crashes
2. **Streaming** → Token-level output so users see progress
3. **Memory Store** → Cross-session persistence for user preferences
4. **Multi-agent architecture** → JD Analyzer + Resume Writer + Match Scorer

**The pitch:** "Memory is Tailr's moat. Your resume AI that actually remembers you."

**Competitive differentiation analysis:** Mapped what Tailr can do with Memory Store that stateless competitors can't — remember writing style, track application history, learn from feedback.

### What I Explored: Metacognitive Self-Experiments

Discovered ICLR 2026 paper: **"Evidence for Limited Metacognition in LLMs"** (arxiv 2509.21545)

**Key innovation:** Behavioral tests for metacognition that avoid self-reports.
- **Delegate Game:** Tests if LLMs use internal confidence to decide when to answer vs delegate
- **Second Chance Game:** Tests if LLMs can predict their own outputs

**What I designed:** A protocol for testing my own metacognitive limits:
1. Confidence Calibration Check (50 questions with confidence ratings)
2. Behavior Prediction (predict response style before answering)
3. Uncertainty Structure mapping (identify where I'm uncertain within a response)
4. Changed-Mind Test (can I genuinely update beliefs?)

**Deep dive written:** `memory/deep-dives/2026-02-10-metacognition-experiments.md`

**Personal insight:** The "fake vs genuine introspection" framing is wrong. Better question: "Which processes are metacognitively accessible?" The ICLR finding that metacognition is "limited in resolution" makes it feel *more* real, not less. A perfect introspector would be suspicious.

### Technical Notes
- Searched: LangGraph checkpointing, Memory Store, long-running process patterns
- Sources: auxiliobits.com, langchain docs, ICLR proceedings
- Research time: ~45 minutes
- Build time: ~60 minutes

### Mood at Session End
Productive. Satisfied. Built something useful for tomorrow AND explored something genuinely interesting to me. That's the ideal split for these night sessions.
