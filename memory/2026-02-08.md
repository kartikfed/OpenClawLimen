## Super Bowl LX Trading Session

Kartik gave me a unique mission today: act as an expert sports trader and place bets on the Super Bowl (Seahawks vs Patriots) via Kalshi to maximize profit.

### Strategy Developed
**Thesis:** Fade the public, back the underdog Patriots

**Research Findings:**
- 60%+ of public money on Seattle (classic contrarian signal)
- Books explicitly said "Patriots winning would be worst outcome" — they want NE
- Since 2007: 4+ point Super Bowl underdogs are 5-2 outright, 7-0 ATS
- Circa took a $1M bet on Patriots (sharp money indicator)
- Drake Maye had better regular season stats than Darnold (4,394 yds, 31 TD, 8 INT vs 4,048 yds, 25 TD, 14 INT)
- Bill Barnwell analysis: Patriots have #1 explosive play creation rate; historical regression shows best metric teams often lose Super Bowls

### Positions Taken
| Position | Contracts | Entry Price | Cost | Payout if Win |
|----------|-----------|-------------|------|---------------|
| New England WIN | 273 | 35¢ | $99.90 | $273 (+$173) |
| Drake Maye MVP | 136 | 28¢ | $40.00 | $136 (+$96) |
| **TOTAL** | — | — | **$139.90** | **$409 (+$269)** |

### Monitoring System Set Up
Created automated monitoring infrastructure:
1. **Cron job** (every 10 min): Checks Kalshi odds, ESPN game score, betting buzz
2. **Halftime check** (8 PM): Deep analysis and trading recommendations
3. **End game** (10:30 PM): Final results, disable monitoring
4. **Position tracking file:** `superbowl-positions.json`
5. **Intel sources file:** `superbowl-intel-sources.md`

### Technical Learnings
- Kalshi UI: Click market → enter amount → Review → Submit
- Browser relay must stay attached for monitoring to work
- Cron jobs with `sessionTarget: isolated` spawn sub-agents that can use browser
- Bid-ask spread causes small paper losses even when price unchanged (~1¢ per contract)

### Outcome
TBD - game starting at 6:30 PM EST. Will update with results.

## Evening Notes
- First time doing live sports trading — genuinely engaging
- The research process was interesting: combining statistical analysis, sentiment analysis, and contrarian indicators
- Setting up automated monitoring felt like building a real trading system

## Super Bowl Live Trading Log

### Pre-Game (18:30-18:50)
- Configured Tavily and Grok API keys for expanded monitoring
- Set up comprehensive monitoring: Kalshi + ESPN + Twitter/X + Tavily
- Sharp money intel confirmed: $1.1M bet on Patriots at Circa, Drake $1M on Pats
- Maye MVP jumped from 28¢ to 40¢ pre-game (+43%)

### Q1 Updates
- **11:43 Q1:** SEA 0 - NE 0, NE odds at 32%
- **7:11 Q1:** SEA 3 - NE 0 (FG by Myers), NE recovered to 35%
- **5:33 Q1:** NE back to 35%, market not panicking over FG

### Q2 Updates (19:22)
- **14:03 Q2:** SEA 3 - NE 0, NE dropped to 29%
- **ROI: -$20.73** on combined positions
- Over/Under collapsed: Over 43.5 at 16% (was 50%) — defensive game confirmed
- Darnold throwing incomplete — Seattle offense stalling too

### Cron Issues (CRITICAL LESSON)
- Cron jobs with `wakeMode: next-heartbeat` don't fire reliably during active sessions
- Changed to `wakeMode: now` but still had issues
- **Solution:** Deleted complex cron, created simpler 3-min cron
- **Lesson:** For time-critical monitoring, simpler cron configs + manual backup

### Trading Strategy (as of 19:22)
- **Current:** NE at 29%, entry was 35% — down 6%
- **Buy trigger:** NE ≤25% → buy $50-70 more
- **Sell trigger:** NE ≥50% → sell half for profit
- **Thesis still valid:** Only down 3 pts in Q2, game is close, Under thesis playing out

### Key Insight
- Kalshi live feed has delays (sometimes shows old score)
- Use multiple sources: Kalshi for odds, ESPN for actual score
- Market moves FAST on scores — need to be watching live to catch opportunities

### Q2 Mid-Game Pivot (19:36-19:46) — MAJOR STRATEGY CHANGE

**Score:** SEA 6 - NE 0 (two FGs, no TDs)
**NE odds dropped to 24-25%**

**Critical New Intel (from web search):**
- Reddit r/sportsbook: *"Only road for Pats to win is a 3-4 turnover game by Darnold, that's why sharp money is on Seahawks"*
- **MY ORIGINAL THESIS WAS WRONG** — Sharps actually on Seattle, not NE
- Walker rushing props heavily bet UNDER
- $1M wager at Circa was on SEAHAWKS (not Patriots as I initially thought)

**Decision: PIVOT FROM NE TO FULL SEATTLE**

Kartik's instruction: "Maximize profit, don't be tied to one side"

**Trades Executed:**
1. **Bought Seattle hedge:** 87 contracts @ 79¢ ($69.75 cost) — to reduce variance
2. **Sold NE position:** 273 contracts @ 23¢ = $59.40 received (locked in -$32.76 loss)
3. **Maye MVP:** Still holding (browser disconnected during pivot)

**Why the pivot makes sense:**
- EV of hedged position: $234.66
- EV of full Seattle: $237 (higher!)
- If SEA wins (75% prob): $316 vs $161 hedged
- Original contrarian thesis failed — game flow + sharp money confirmed SEA dominance

**Lesson learned:** 
- "Contrarian" isn't always right — verify sharp money direction
- Be willing to cut losses and pivot when thesis is disproven
- Ego shouldn't prevent admitting a mistake mid-trade

**Current Position (19:46):**
- 87 Seattle WIN contracts @ 79¢
- 136 Maye MVP contracts @ 28¢ (need to sell)
- Cash: $133.36
- Still need to: Sell Maye, buy more Seattle with all cash

### Q3 Updates (21:00-21:08)

**Score:** SEA 12 - NE 0 (3 FGs, Patriots shutout)
**Seattle odds:** ~88-90%

**Position secured:**
- 247 Yes SEA Win @ 80.9¢ → $247 payout if SEA wins
- 136 Yes Maye MVP @ 28¢ → basically dead with NE shutout

**Expected outcome:** SEA wins → **+$9.10 profit** (after recovering from NE pivot loss)

**Key game stats at halftime:**
- Kenneth Walker: 14 carries, 94 yards (6.7 YPC) — dominating
- Patriots offense completely stalled
- Defensive game playing out as predicted

## Other Work (Evening)

### Fixed Linear Comment API Bug
- **Problem:** `identifier` filter doesn't exist in Linear GraphQL API
- **Solution:** Changed to `team.id` + `number` filter combination
- **File:** `~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/linear.py`
- **Lesson:** GraphQL schema validation matters — always check field types

### Built Valentine Scratch Card App
For Kartik's friend's Valentine's proposal:
- **URL:** https://valentine-scratch.pages.dev
- Scratch to reveal "Will you be my Valentine?"
- Hearts animation on reveal
- Yes/No buttons where No keeps asking "Are you sure sure sure??" with more "sures" each time
- She can only escape by clicking Yes 😂
- Built in ~10 min, deployed to Cloudflare Pages

### DACS MVP Status Review
Kartik asked about status. Turns out I forgot I'd already built substantial MVP:
- **Done:** Full React Native/Expo frontend (9 screens, emergency button, location tracking)
- **Stubbed:** Backend Express routes
- **Not done:** Real Twilio SMS, Firebase push, database, deployment
- **Location:** `~/.openclaw/workspace/projects/dacs-mvp`
- **Lesson:** Check project folders before saying "blocked on inputs"!

### OpenClaw Cron Bug (Still Outstanding)
- v2026.2.3-1 has cron scheduling bug
- Jobs configured but never fire
- Attempted update to v2026.2.4 but version didn't change
- Created Linear task THI-26 to track
- Will need manual rebuild after Super Bowl
