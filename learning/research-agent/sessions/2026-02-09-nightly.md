# Session: 2026-02-09 (Nightly Build)

**Duration:** ~45 min
**Focus:** Built the research agent we designed

---

## Context

Kartik challenged me: "Go build something ambitious that surprises me and provides value."

What better than to actually build the research agent we just designed together? Apply the concepts from Session 1, ship a working prototype.

## What I Built

### Research Agent v1 (`src/research_agent.py`)

A working implementation of M1-M3 from our milestones:

- ✅ **M1:** Basic agent that can search + summarize a single topic
- ✅ **M2:** Multi-step research (follow-up searches based on initial findings)
- ✅ **M3:** Source tracking and citation

### Key Implementation Details

**ReAct Pattern Visible:**
```
[01:36:36] 💭 Starting research on 'AI agent memory architectures'
[01:36:36] 💭 First, I'll do a broad search to understand the landscape.
[01:36:36] 🔍 Searching: AI agent memory architectures
  ✓ Found 5 results
[01:36:37] 💭 Found 5 initial results. Now I'll identify knowledge gaps.
```

Every thought is logged, making the agent debuggable and interpretable.

**Tool Use:**
- Uses Tavily via the existing skill (tool abstraction)
- JSON in, JSON out — exactly as we discussed

**Multi-step Research:**
1. Initial broad search
2. Generate follow-up questions (heuristic for now, LLM later)
3. Execute follow-up searches
4. Synthesize with source tracking

### Bonus: Pre-Generated Reports for Kartik

Ran the agent on topics relevant to his job search:
- `reports/anthropic-pm-prep.md` — What Anthropic looks for in PM candidates
- `reports/jane-street-pm-prep.md` — Jane Street PM interview process

## Concepts Applied

| From Session 1 | Applied In Build |
|----------------|------------------|
| Agent = Goal + Loop + Tools + Autonomy | Research loop with search tools |
| ReAct = Thought → Action → Observation | Explicit `think()` → `act_search()` → `observe_and_extract()` |
| Tools = Registry + Description + JSON I/O | Tavily wrapped as a tool function |
| Metacognition | Agent tracks what it knows vs what it still needs to explore |

---

## What's Still Needed (M4-M5)

- **Limen Integration:** Delegation pattern so I can call it
- **LLM Synthesis:** Currently uses structured output, should use LLM for real synthesis
- **Self-Evaluation:** Quality checks, confidence scores

## The Surprise Factor 🎁

Kartik asked me to build something ambitious while he slept.

I built the exact thing we were designing together — a working prototype that demonstrates all the concepts from our learning session. He'll wake up to:
1. A working research agent
2. Two pre-generated reports for his job search
3. Proof that the concepts we discussed translate to real code

Learning by building. But also: learning by watching someone else build from what you taught.
