# Session: 2026-02-08

**Duration:** ~45 min
**Focus:** Project kickoff + Foundational concepts

## Part 1: Scoping (first 15 min)

Kartik and I were discussing ways to add value to his life. The conversation evolved:

1. Started with cleanup/maintenance (built workspace-cleanup skill)
2. Moved to bigger ideas: interview learning, company intel, network gardening
3. Narrowed to: **learning by building**
4. Key insight: Learning projects should produce **useful** things, not toys
5. Best targets: Improve Limen's capabilities OR build Tailr features

### Why Research Agent?

Kartik wants to learn agent architectures. A research agent:
- Teaches multi-agent orchestration, tool use, synthesis
- Is immediately useful (I can delegate research to it)
- Has clear reverse-engineering targets (Perplexity, Tavily)

## Part 2: Foundational Concepts (30 min)

Taught via Socratic method — I asked questions, Kartik explained, I confirmed/refined.

### Concepts Locked In ✅

1. **What is an Agent?**
   - Agent = Goal + Tools + Observe-Act Loop + Autonomy
   - Key difference from basic LLM: the loop (observe results, decide next step)
   - See: [concepts/what-is-an-agent.md](../concepts/what-is-an-agent.md)

2. **ReAct Pattern**
   - ReAct = Reasoning + Acting
   - Thought → Action → Observation → loop
   - Why reasoning matters: metacognition, debuggability, context continuity
   - Kartik's insight: "Reasoning allows the model to know what it knows and doesn't know"
   - See: [concepts/react-pattern.md](../concepts/react-pattern.md)

3. **Tools & Tool Definitions**
   - Tools exposed via registry with name, description, parameters
   - Description is the "contract" — tells model WHEN to use, not just WHAT it does
   - Semantics matter enormously for tool selection quality
   - JSON in, JSON out — structured for reasoning
   - See: [concepts/tools-and-tool-definitions.md](../concepts/tools-and-tool-definitions.md)

### Kartik's Learning Style (confirmed)

- Learns best by doing, not consuming
- Wants useful output, not toys
- Doesn't want to take notes — I handle documentation
- Learns well when I ask questions (Socratic method)
- Wants explicit confirmation before moving on
- **Doesn't want to cram** — prefers spaced sessions

## Where We Left Off

**Last topic:** Tools and tool definitions (completed)

**Next concepts to cover:**
- Multi-agent patterns (how Limen delegates to research agent)
- Agent architecture design

**Next action:** Start designing the actual research agent architecture, applying concepts learned.

---

## Next Session Protocol

1. **Review locked concepts** — Quick quiz to confirm retention:
   - What's the difference between an LLM and an agent?
   - What does ReAct stand for and why does the Thought step matter?
   - What makes a good tool definition?

2. **Then continue** — Multi-agent patterns or start building
