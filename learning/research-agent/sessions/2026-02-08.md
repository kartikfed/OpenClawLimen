# Session: 2026-02-08

**Duration:** ~15 min (scoping only)
**Focus:** Project kickoff and structure setup

## Context

Kartik and I were discussing ways to add value to his life. The conversation evolved:

1. Started with cleanup/maintenance (built workspace-cleanup skill)
2. Moved to bigger ideas: interview learning, company intel, network gardening
3. Narrowed to: **learning by building**
4. Key insight: Learning projects should produce **useful** things, not toys
5. Best targets: Improve Limen's capabilities OR build Tailr features

## Why Research Agent?

Kartik wants to learn agent architectures. A research agent:
- Teaches multi-agent orchestration, tool use, synthesis
- Is immediately useful (I can delegate research to it)
- Has clear reverse-engineering targets (Perplexity, Tavily)

## What We Defined

**Goal:** Limen can delegate deep research to a specialized agent

**Milestones:**
1. Basic search + summarize
2. Multi-step follow-up research
3. Source tracking
4. Limen integration
5. Self-evaluation

## Kartik's Learning Style (noted)

- Learns best by doing, not consuming
- Wants visible output
- Doesn't want to take notes — I handle that
- Likes when I ask him questions (teach by teaching)

## Questions That Came Up

- (None technical yet — session was about scoping)

## Next Session

- [ ] Look at how Perplexity/Tavily structure their research flows
- [ ] Design the basic agent architecture together
- [ ] Kartik builds first version (M1)
