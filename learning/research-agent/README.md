# Project: Research Agent

**Goal:** Build a research agent that Limen can delegate to for deep dives.

**Value:** When Kartik asks Limen to research something, instead of doing shallow searches, Limen delegates to a focused research agent that goes deep — multiple searches, follows links, synthesizes — then reports back.

**What Kartik Learns:**
- Multi-agent orchestration (main agent ↔ research agent)
- Tool use (web search, browsing, scraping)
- Information synthesis & summarization
- Agent communication patterns
- Evaluation (how do we know the research is good?)

**Reverse Engineering Inspiration:**
- Perplexity's research flow
- Tavily's search agent
- OpenAI's deep research feature

## Milestones

- [ ] **M1:** Basic agent that can search + summarize a single topic
- [ ] **M2:** Multi-step research (follow-up searches based on initial findings)
- [ ] **M3:** Source tracking and citation
- [ ] **M4:** Integration with Limen (delegation pattern)
- [ ] **M5:** Quality evaluation (self-critique, confidence scores)
