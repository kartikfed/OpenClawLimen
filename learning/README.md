# Learning Lab

Kartik's hands-on learning projects. Each project teaches concepts by building something useful.

## Philosophy

- **Learn by building** — not courses, not notes, working things
- **Useful output** — every project improves real life (Limen, Tailr, personal tools)
- **I do the heavy lifting** — Kartik chats, asks questions, builds. I document, organize, track progress.

## How This Works

1. **Kartik mentions wanting to learn something** → I design a project
2. **We build together** → Sessions captured in `sessions/`
3. **Concepts emerge** → I extract to `concepts/`
4. **Questions flow naturally** → I capture and answer, track what's asked
5. **Progress is visible** → Each project has clear milestones

## Active Projects

## Completed Projects

(None yet — first one starting!)

## Concepts Index

As concepts emerge from projects, they get documented in [`concepts/`](./concepts/).
