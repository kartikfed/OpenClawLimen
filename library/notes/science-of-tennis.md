## The Physics (Rod Cross, University of Sydney)

### 1. The Sweet Spots
A tennis racquet has multiple "sweet spots":

**Node Point (True Sweet Spot)**
- Located near the center of the strings
- When ball impacts here, vibration transmitted to hand is minimal
- This is NOT where the ball rebounds with maximum speed

**Center of Percussion (COP)**
- The point where there's minimal reaction force on the hand
- Shifts when the racquet is held (vs. freely suspended)
- When held in hand, COP moves to the throat area

**Dead Spot**
- Near the tip of the racquet
- Ball doesn't bounce at all here
- All energy transfers to racquet, none returns to ball
- GOOD for serving (racquet gives energy to ball)
- BAD for returning fast serves

### 2. Where to Hit the Ball

| Situation | Best Contact Point | Why |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| **Serving** | Near the TIP (dead spot) | All racquet energy → ball |
| **Returning shots** | Near the CENTER | Best bounce, most control |
| **Fast incoming serves** | Near the THROAT | Ball bounces best here |

### 3. Racquet Vibration
- **Stiff racquets:** 180 Hz or higher
- **Flexible racquets:** 140 Hz or lower
- Impact duration ~5ms determines which frequencies are excited
- String vibrations occur at ~500 Hz

### 4. Ball Compression & Energy Loss
- Ball dropped on concrete: loses ~45% energy, compresses ~6mm
- Ball dropped on strings: loses ~30% energy, compresses ~3mm
- Higher speed = more compression = more energy lost
- Strings absorb impact energy and return it to the ball

### 5. Spin Physics (The Modern Game)
The evolution from wood to graphite racquets:
1. Head size increased from 9" to 10.5"
2. Larger head = less frame clipping = more topspin possible
3. More topspin = ball dives sharper after net = can hit harder
4. Hitting harder = even more topspin = can hit even harder

**This feedback loop explains why modern tennis is so much faster than the wood era.**

The pace increase isn't from "more powerful racquets" - it's from wider heads enabling topspin, which enables power.

### 6. The Magnus Effect (Spin Aerodynamics)
- Topspin: Ball rotates forward, air pressure higher on top → ball dives down
- Backspin/Slice: Opposite effect → ball floats longer
- Sidespin: Ball curves laterally

Topspin rates in pro tennis:
- **Nadal forehand:** Up to 4,900 RPM (the highest recorded)
- **Average pro:** 2,500-3,500 RPM
- **Federer:** Lower spin (~2,000 RPM) but flatter, faster shots

### 7. Court Surface Physics
Different surfaces affect:
- **Friction coefficient** → how much spin "bites"
- **Ball compression on bounce** → speed retention
- **Energy absorption** → how much pace is lost

| Surface | Speed | Bounce | Favors |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Grass | Fast | Low, skids | Serve-and-volley, flat hitters |
| Clay | Slow | High, grips | Baseliners, heavy topspin |
| Hard | Medium | Medium, true | All-around players |

### 8. Serve Biomechanics
The kinetic chain (energy flows from):
1. **Legs** (ground reaction force)
2. **Hips** (rotation)
3. **Trunk** (core rotation)
4. **Shoulder** (internal rotation)
5. **Elbow** (extension)
6. **Wrist** (pronation/snap)
7. **Racquet** (final acceleration)

Each segment decelerates as the next accelerates → energy transfers up the chain.

Pro servers generate ~2,500° of shoulder internal rotation per second.

## Key Insights

1. **Sweet spot ≠ power spot** — Where the ball bounces best isn't where you feel least vibration
2. **Modern tennis speed** comes from topspin, not racquet technology
3. **Where you hit on the strings** should change based on whether you're attacking or defending
4. **Nadal's success** is literally physics — his extreme topspin (4,900 RPM) lets him hit harder while keeping balls in
