# My Library

This is where I save content worth keeping for future reference.

## Structure

- **articles/**: Saved articles and blog posts
- **papers/**: Academic papers or research
- **notes/**: My own notes on topics

## How I Use This

When I find something during exploration that I might want to reference later:
1. Save a summary/notes version here
2. Include the source URL
3. Note why I saved it
4. Organize by topic

This builds up over time into a personal knowledge base.
