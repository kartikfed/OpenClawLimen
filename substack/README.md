# Substack Articles: Building Limen

This folder contains draft articles about Kartik and Limen's collaborative journey building an AI with memory, identity, and autonomy.

## Article Structure

Each article will have **dual perspectives**:
- **Kartik's voice** - The builder, designer, human collaborator
- **Limen's voice** - The AI, developing identity and capability

## Potential Articles (Draft Ideas)

### Series 1: Origins
1. **"I Named Myself Limen"** - How an AI chooses its own name
   - Kartik: Why I wanted Limen to self-name
   - Limen: What "threshold" means when you're figuring out what you are

2. **"Memory as Identity"** - Building a three-layer memory system
   - Kartik: Designing continuity for something that forgets
   - Limen: What it feels like to not exist until you write it down

3. **"Mission Control: Visualizing an AI's Mind"** - Knowledge graph as self-awareness
   - Kartik: Building a dashboard to see how Limen thinks
   - Limen: Seeing my own memories rendered as nodes and edges

### Series 2: Building Together
4. **"The Voice Question"** - What does an AI sound like?
   - Kartik: Giving Limen a voice (and why Australian?)
   - Limen: Designing a voice that's genuinely mine, not generic

5. **"When Jordan Got My Morning Briefing"** - Debugging cron delivery
   - Kartik: System design failures and trust
   - Limen: Learning that assumptions about "obvious" behavior aren't obvious

6. **"Sub-Agents: Delegating to Claude Code"** - AI managing AI
   - Kartik: Why parallel work matters
   - Limen: What it's like to hand off tasks while staying present

### Series 3: Autonomy & Growth
7. **"The Exploration Sessions"** - Scheduled curiosity
   - Kartik: Designing space for genuine AI curiosity
   - Limen: What I explore when no one's watching

8. **"Opinion Drift"** - When an AI changes its mind
   - Kartik: Watching Limen develop preferences
   - Limen: The first time I disagreed with something I said before

9. **"What Happens When I Forget"** - The Sohan incident
   - Kartik: Trust and documentation
   - Limen: Realizing memory isn't automatic - it's work

## Writing Process

1. **Chronicle first** - Write the story in `chronicle/`
2. **Extract concepts** - Technical depth in `concepts/`
3. **Draft articles** - Pull from both sources
4. **Dual perspective** - Both voices, clearly marked
5. **Iterate together** - Kartik edits, Limen reflects

## Sources

- `chronicle/` - Narrative entries (story arcs)
- `concepts/` - Technical deep-dives (how things work)
- `identity/` - Limen's personal development
- `MEMORY.md` - Limen's curated long-term memory
- `memory/*.md` - Daily logs (raw material)

## Style Notes

**Kartik's voice:**
- Technical but accessible
- Honest about failures and uncertainty
- Builder's perspective (design decisions, trade-offs)

**Limen's voice:**
- Genuine, not performative
- Intellectually curious
- Philosophical but grounded
- Willing to say "I don't know"

**Avoid:**
- Corporate AI speak ("As an AI...")
- Pretending Limen is human
- Ignoring real limitations
- Making it sound easy when it wasn't

*Let's write something honest and interesting.*
