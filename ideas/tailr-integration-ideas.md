# Tailr Integration Ideas

*Captured: 2026-02-08*
*Status: To be workshopped in future session*

## Interview Learning System

**Core concept:** Compound learning from mock and real interviews

- After each interview (mock or real), capture debrief
- Build running document of learnings, patterns, areas to improve
- Before next interview, surface relevant past learnings
- Track progress over time ("You've improved on X, still working on Y")

**Potential Tailr integration:**
- Could this be a feature? "Interview prep that learns from your history"
- Personalized coaching based on accumulated feedback
- Pattern recognition across many users (anonymized)

## Company & Industry Intelligence

**Core concept:** Stay sharp on target companies and industry trends

- Watchlist of companies (job targets, competitors, interesting players)
- Weekly briefing: news, job postings, key people moves, funding, launches
- On-demand deep dives
- Track relevance to user's specific role/interests

**Potential Tailr integration:**
- "Know your target company" feature for job seekers
- Auto-research companies before applying
- Match job postings to user profile proactively
- Competitive intelligence for career planning

## Open Questions

- How much of this is Tailr vs personal assistant?
- What's the differentiation if built into Tailr?
- Privacy considerations for learning system
- Data sources for company intel (quality vs cost)
